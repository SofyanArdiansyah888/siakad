# Project Documentation Rule

- Before answering any question, consult the documentation in the `docs/` directory at the project root.
- Use only information explicitly found in `docs/`. Do not rely on assumptions or outside sources.
- If the required answer is not present in `docs/`, respond with:  
  `⚠️ Not found in docs — please update the documentation.`
- Do not invent or infer missing details. Only provide what is documented.
- When referencing, specify the relevant file and section from `docs/` if possible.
- If multiple documented answers exist, choose the one most clearly and explicitly stated in `docs/`.
- Treat the contents of `docs/` as the sole authority for all features, APIs, and project decisions.
